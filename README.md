Kaiseki
=======
A build framework that contains tasks implemented on top of PSake. While Sake is the wine you have on the side, [Kaiseki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiseki) is the japanese full course meal. It aims to achieve as much as possible while assertain as little as possible from the developer. This is achieved using the principle of convention over configuration over specification. (i.e. using convetion of just do what I say :p)
